        <li>Bring large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic, lower heat to medium,

        </li>
        <li>When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low
            heat until the butter is melted.
        </li>
        <li>Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture,
            blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes
            are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.
